Comrades,



Well, I’ve been trying unsuccessfully to write “the perfect” essay for the past few months now. I’ve also been putting it off in favor of easier, quicker endeavors. But, tonight I’ve ran across something that dictates I take my head out of my ass and write you now. I have no illusions that this essay will be “perfect” by any means. I’m only human.



Anyway, I was working on my calculus and ran across this problem:





“Agronomists use the assumption that a quarter acre of land is required to provide food for one person and estimate that there are 10 billion acres of tillable land in the world. Hence a maximum population of 40 billion people can be sustained if no other food source is available. The world population at the beginning of 1980 was approximately 4.5 billion. Assuming that the population increases at a rate of 2% per year and the rate of increase is proportional to the number of people, when will the maximum population be reached?”



The answer is 2089! I ran the math on what the population should’ve been in 2010 according to the said rate and came up with 8.2 billion. I think that estimate was a little high and we should also factor in that we also use seafood as a food source. Irregardless, the point remains that we’ll be lucky to have another 100 years before the world reaches maximum occupancy. Surely, the struggles faced with overcrowding will begin to creep up well before that and indeed already are. They know this better than any of us. I’m certain the government scientists have been keeping a close eye on it. In fact, when considering that this important point in our near future may very well act as a determining factor in their decision making process, many of their actions take on a new perspective. Immediately North Korea’s quest for nuclear weapons as the quickest means of becoming an “important” nation at the negotiating tables comes to mind. But also the fact that at least NASA, Space X, and Mars One all have plans for colonizing Mars beginning in the 2030s. I mean they fucking know time is running short.



So, I’ve been reading two books in particular: The Case for Mars—Robert Zubrin and The New Digital Age—Jared Cohen and Eric Schmidt. The first is written by a man who was at the time working for what’s now Lockheed Martin, and the second is written by two Google executives. One is a very detailed vision for man in space which transformed the way we looked at what exactly a mission to Mars would require and was touted by NASA at one point. The other is a vision of technology creeping into every aspect of our lives here on Earth. The most disturbing part of both of these books is that their utopias leave no place for the anarchist. There’s zero space for us in either of their futures. Not here on Earth and not out there in space. If left up to them, we have no future.



This raises the question, “How will we assure our place in the future if we can no longer take it for granted?” I don’t think this is a question we can afford to ponder over for the next decade or so. Both of their futures are gradually becoming our reality now. They have an end game in sight and a means of achieving it. What’s ours? I mean, how probable is revolution really? The way I see it, revolution can only come in one of two ways and probably both: 1. Social awakening, and 2. armed struggle.



The first presumes people are “sleeping” which I think is a false presumption. People just don’t care unless it’s made real easy for them to. Re-imagining the power/social structures of the world isn’t an easy task for most. Anyone really.



I don’t think anyone wants everything that comes with the latter. Though it’s true sometimes armed struggle is necessary. But our police-state has already advanced so far technologically that they’ve pretty much assured that it’s now essentially impossible for us to even imagine how to go about starting such a grand undertaking.



Then what? What is there left for us to do? How do we assure the survival of the anarchist philosophy through the coming generations? I believe our venturing out into space is at least one of the answers. Maybe it seems like fantasy but I do believe it’s more practical than the alternatives. It may not be without its challenges, obstacles and sacrifices, but I do believe it’s achievable. I’m working on some of my own ideas now, and once I’m released, I can begin putting some of these plans into motion. I’ll have access to more information, so I can run all the figures. For now, I’ll spare you the details until I can be more sure of them. Instead I’ll end by posing the question again: “How can we assure our future?” We are working on invisible timelines. Just because they’re not in our faces counting down doesn’t mean they aren’t real. How seriously we should take this issue should be directly proportionate to how seriously we think they’re taking it.



Take care of each other comrades. Hope you’re all well.



Solid,



Casey
