\* \* \* THE LAKE ON MARS! \* \* \*



 That's right there's a lake on Mars, and you can visit! Opening this vacation season, the Solar System is introducing the Red Rum Resort—the first non-terrestrial vacation venue.



This five-star resort offers a private liquid water lake and unique views. The Red Rum has all the flavor of the Caribbean on an exotic and unexplored Martian lake. That means you and your family can sit back, on the beach, drink Mai Thais and be one of the first few to discover places and things where no man has gone before!

With  200 luxury suites, 4 restaurants, 2 indoor pools, the resort itself can easily say it's the biggest on the planet. Not to mention the first!

The Red Rum, setup as a 501(c)3 non-profit proudly puts 100% of its profits toward securing Martian land in trust and terraforming the new planet for all men to enjoy. Your dollars go to support proud American men and women on the new frontier.
